## Summary: 

Based on the statistics, the surf and ice cream shop business appears to be sustainable year-round given the similarities between June and December weather statistics. The weather appears to never be too cold for ice cream and always be just right for surfing.

While the temperatures appears to be great for both ice cream and surfing, two additional queries that I would perform to gether more weather data for June and December are:

- Wind and rain conditions query are important pieces of information because they can impact wind chill which can make temperatures fill colder than they are
- Surf conditions query and tide information could also be helpful. If the average wave size is higher than what beginners or tourists are used to, it could impact business as well. Also, are there times where the waves are too flat to ride?
